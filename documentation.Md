## Documentation:

As you can see, the app is basically self explanatory. This version  of the app works on 3 different distributions: Normal, Binomial and Exponential Distributions. The side-bar of the "Statistics" tab is itself an interactive UI. First, you are asked to select a distribution to work on. Based on the distribution selected, The parameters of the distribution needed to be provided are designed to change.

For every parameter you change, the main panel is designed to show a plot that uses your inputs in the side panel that fits the distribution. The plot is designed through plotly, so the plot made is interactive too. Feel free to play around. At the end, based on the quantile cut you give as the slider input, the output will show where the quantile cuts the distribution in numerical quantity, rounded of to two decimals.
