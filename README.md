# Distrostats
This is my first Shiny App. Visit --> https://phoenix2996.shinyapps.io/distrostats/

You can find the documentation for the app at http://rpubs.com/phoenix2996/c9w4

This was created as a part of my final assignment in the **"Developing Data Products"** Course on Coursera, offered by **John Hopkins University** as a part of my specialization in **Data Science**.
This repo is the source code for the above mentioned app, which is a simple work on studying numerical distributions, totally self explanatory.

Thanks for Prof. Brian Caffo for walking me through the basics.
